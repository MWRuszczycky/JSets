# The difference between the <monthly> and <once-monthly> publication
# frequencies is that a <monthly> journal is assumed to publish at
# reliably regular intervals (i.e., every 28 or 35 days) so that
# there is one issue every month. In contrast, a <once-monthly>
# journal is assumed to publish one issue every month sometime before
# the end of the month. To ensure journal set dates are not
# underestimated use once-monthly if in doubt.
