    See also: ranks.

MATCH FILE
    The match file takes the form (comments begin with #):

        # Match file for Journal Set 21, January 9, 2021:

        # Articles to be matched to presenters
        title: long
            1 2 5 7 8 9 10 12 13
        title: short
            3 4 6 11

        # Presenter preferences for each article
        green  : 12 > 1 > 3 > 5 > 11 > 8
        blue   : 1 > 2 > 3 > 7 = 8 > 13 > 11 = 12 > 9 > 4 = 6 > 5 > 10
        red    : 8
        yellow :

    This example describes two matches involving 13 articles and four presenters
    (green, blue, red & yellow). The two matches are user-named 'long' and
    'short' with the <title> keyword. The articles in each match will be
    assigned in separate matching runs. The rankings indicate that blue prefers
    article 1 the most, 10 the least and is indifferent with respect to articles
    7 and 8, but prefers them both more than 13 and less than 3. Note that green
    has no preference with respect to articles 2, 7, 9, etc., and red prefers
    article 8 but does not care about any of the others. Yellow has no
    preferences whatsoever. Rankings formatted in this way can be easily created
    using the HTML document generated with the <ranks> command.
