SYNOPSIS
    jsets doi DOI [DOI]... [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    Obtain citations via direct doi lookup. JSets primarily uses PubMed for
    citation lookup (see the <query> and <pmid> commands); however, some
    articles are not registered at PubMed. The <doi> command allows the
    citations for these articles to be obtained directly.

FORMATS
    Text (txt, default) and Markdown (mkd, md).
