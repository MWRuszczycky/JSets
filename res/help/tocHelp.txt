SYNOPSIS
    jsets toc FILE [FILE]... [--key=NUMBER] [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    Generates tables-of-contents files from a journal set or selection FILEs.
    The command downloads content information for each issue in a specified
    journal set in the FILEs and generates output with all the corresponding
    citations under each issue header sorted by page number. If more than one
    FILE is provided as an argument, then the journal sets in each of the files
    are collected together by journal set number. If there is only one journal
    set in the resulting collection, then no set NUMBER is necessary, and the
    single journal set will be used to query PubMed for content information. If
    there are multiple journal sets, then a journal set NUMBER must be provided
    using the --key option.

    When the output format is HTML, the tables-of-contents output will be an
    interactive web page that can be used to select articles for review and
    generate a selection file. Selection files can also be used with the <toc>
    command to generate tables-of-contents output. If tables-of-contents are
    generated as HTML from a selection file, then the selected articles will be
    highlighted.

FORMATS
    Text (txt, default), Markdown (mkd, md) and HTML (html). The use of the HTML
    format allows interactive selection of articles for review. Journal sets
    files can be read as either CSV or text.

EXAMPLES
    Generate an interactive tables-of-contents file from journal set 5 in the
    text file jsets2020.txt:
        $ jsets toc jsets2020.txt --key=5 --output=toc5.html

    Generate an interactive tables-of-contents from multiple selection files
    (selected articles will be highlighted):
        $ jsets toc selection1.txt selection2.txt selection3.txt --output=toc.html

    Same as above, but using a single-character glob
        $ jsets toc selection?.txt --output=toc.html
