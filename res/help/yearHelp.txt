SYNOPSIS
    jsets year YEAR [WEEKS] [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    Compute journal sets for all configured and followed journals in the
    specified YEAR. The journal sets are computed at a frequency of every WEEKS
    (default 2). The dates listed in a journal sets file computed using the
    <year> command are for the user's information only. Therefore, the journal
    sets file can be edited to move issues between journal sets as necessary.
    The journal set dates can then be recomputed using the <read> command.

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
    --by-date
        Sort issues by date before grouping them into journal sets. This will
        tend to make the journal sets become available sooner. In contrast, the
        default behavior is to group the weekly journals separately from
        non-weekly journals. The default behavior thus tries to get an equal
        number of issues of each weekly journal in each journal set.

FORMATS
    Text (txt, default), Markdown (mkd, md) and CSV (csv). The text and CSV
    formats can be read by other commands. The text format is equivalent to a
    selection file with no selections.

EXAMPLES
    Generate 26 journal sets (2 week frequency) for 2019 and save as text:
       $ jsets year 2019 --output=jsets2019.txt

    Generate 52 journal sets (1 week frequency) for 2020 and save as csv:
       $ jsets year 2020 1 --output=jsets2020.csv
