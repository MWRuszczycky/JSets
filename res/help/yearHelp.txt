Usage: jsets year YEAR

Distributes all issues for all configured journals in the specified
YEAR (entered as an integer) into 26 journal sets. The default output
format is txt, and it is sent to standard out. Other supported output
formats are csv and Markdown. To choose another output format, use
the --output/-o option to specify a path with the desired extension.
For example, to generate 26 journal sets covering 2019 and save them
in csv format use

    jsets year 2019 --output=jsets2019.csv

You can read the resulting file (in csv or txt) and convert it to
other output formats using the <read> command.
