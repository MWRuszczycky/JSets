Usage: jsets year YEAR [FREQ]

Distributes all issues for all configured journals in the specified
YEAR (entered as an integer) into journal sets at a frequency of FREQ
weeks. The default frequency is 2 weeks. The default output format is
txt, and it is sent to standard-out. Other supported output formats
are csv and Markdown. To choose another output format, use the
--output/-o option to specify a path with the desired extension.

For example, to generate 26 journal sets (2 week frequency) covering
2019 and save them in csv format use

    jsets year 2019 --output=jsets2019.csv

to generate 52 journal sets (1 week frequency) covering 2020 and
save them in txt form use

    jsets year 2020 1 --output=jsets2020.txt

You can read the resulting file (in csv or txt) and convert it to
other output formats using the <read> command.
