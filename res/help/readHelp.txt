SYNOPSIS
    jsets read FILE [FILE]...  [--key=NUMBER] [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    Reads one or more FILEs containing one or more journal sets formatted as
    either CSV or text. These files can be first generated using the year
    command, and then edited. All journal sets are collected together between
    FILEs by their journal set number. If only a single journal set is desired,
    its set NUMBER can be specified with --key. The read command can be used to
    convert journal set files between different formats.

FORMATS
    The <read> command accepts journal set files as either text or CSV. The
    supported output formats are text (default, txt), Markdown (md or mkd) and
    CSV (csv).

EXAMPLES
    Print the issues in journal set 5 from the file jsets2019.txt:
        $ jsets read jsets2019.txt --key=5

    Convert text-formatted journal sets in jsets2019.txt to a CSV-file:
        $ jsets read jsets2019.txt --output=jsets2019.csv
