Usage: jsets read FILE [FILE]

Reads one or more files containing one or more journal sets formatted
as either csv or txt. These files can be first generated using the
<year> command, and then edited. All journal sets are collected
together between files by their journal set number, which must be a
non-negative integer. The resulting journal sets are then output to
standard-out as text. If only a single journal set is desired, you
can use the --key/-k option to specify its journal set number.

You can use the <read> command to convert journal set files between
different formats. This is done by using the --output/-o option and
specifying an output file name with the appropriate extension. For
example, if you have a journal sets file <jsets2019.txt> in txt
format and you want to convert it to csv, you can run the following

    jsets read jsets2019.txt --output=jsets2019.csv

If you want to output just journal set 5 in a csv file of journal
sets using Markdown format, use

    jsets read jsets2019.csv --key=5 --output=jsets2019.md

The supported output formats are csv, Markdown (mkd or md) and txt.
