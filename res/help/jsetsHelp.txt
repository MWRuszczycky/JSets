SYNOPSIS
    jsets [ COMMAND [ARGUMENT]... [OPTION]...  | --help | --version ]

DESCRIPTION
    General
        JSets helps to keep track of which issues to review for Literature
        Review. It also facilitates the selection of articles from those issues.
        Finally, JSets helps to assign the selected articles for review.

        JSets works closely with PubMed and provides a basic command line
        interface for making ESearch and ESummary queries at PubMed.

    The basic workflow
        1. The <year> command is used to generate the journal sets for a given
           year based on a set of configured journals.

        2. The <meetings> command is used to schedule the meetings and
           presenters for Literature Review.

        3. The <toc> command is used to generate an interactive HTML document
           containing the tables of contents for all issues in a given journal
           set.

        4. The tables-of-contents HTML document can be used to construct a
           selection file listing the articles one is interested in reviewing.

        5. Multiple selection files can be combined using the <toc> command and
           used to generate another tables-of-contents file with the selected
           articles highlighted.

        6. The highlighted tables of contents are sent to the boss for the final
           selection.

        7. The <ranks> command is used with the final selection to generate an
           HTML document that can be used to rank the selected articles by
           preference.

        8. The <match> command is used to assign the articles to each presenter
           based on their preferences.
