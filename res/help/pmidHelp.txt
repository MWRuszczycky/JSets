Usage: jsets pmid PMID [PMID]

Download article citations from PubMed based on their PubMed ids.
The downloaded citations will be ordered according to their PubMed
ids and can be formatted as either text or Markdown. If the article
is found in a configured journal after the date of the corresponding
reference issue, then the issue will be resolved based on the issue
calculated for the given volume number and issue number. Note that
this may not work if multiple volumes are published each year as in
the case of Nature and Science (in this case, JSets currently uses
the year as the volume number). If the issue cannot be resolved from
the configuration, then the issue will be directly read from PubMed.
