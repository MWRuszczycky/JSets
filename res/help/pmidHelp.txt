SYNOPSIS
    jsets pmid PMID...

DESCRIPTION
    Download one or more citations from PubMed according to their PubMed IDs.
    The command composes all the listed PubMed IDs into a single ESearch request
    that is sent to PubMed. The parsed citation results are returned in the
    lexicographic order of the PubMed IDs.

FORMATS
    Text (txt, default), Markdown (mkd, md) and JSON (json). Use of the JSON
    format will result in only the requested JSON object being returned
    unparsed.

EXAMPLES
    Request citations as formatted text for the PubMed IDs 6626520 and 28874588:
       $ jsets pmid 6626520 28874588

    Same as above, but save as the composite ESearch JSON object:
       $ jsets pmid 6626520 28874588 --output=result.json
