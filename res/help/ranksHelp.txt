Usage: jsets ranks FILE [FILE]

Collect together selections in the FILE arguments and generate a list
of citations/articles for ranking. The default output format is text.
Alternative output formats can be selected using the --output/-o
option and choosing the desired file extension.

When the output format is html, the ranks output is a webpage that
allows users to enter numerical ranks and create a simple rank-list
string that can be emailed to the journal sets administrator. These
can then be collected in a rank-lists file for use with the <match>
command assigning papers to individuals. See help for the <match>
command for more information.

For example, if you have three selection files sel1.txt, sel2.txt and
sel3.txt all for the same journal set, they can be collected and used
to generate the corresponding ranks output in html format using

    jsets ranks sel1.txt sel2.txt sel3.txt --output=ranks.html

If the selections have more than one journal set, then the desired
journal set can be selected using the --key/-k option.
