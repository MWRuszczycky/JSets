Usage: jsets ranks FILE [FILE]

Collect together selections in the FILE arguments and generate a rank
list. The default output format is text. Alternative output formats
can be selected using the --output/-o option and choosing the desired
file extension. When the output format is html, the rank list page
generated allows users to enter numerical ranks and create an easy
ranking string that can be emailed to the journal sets administrator.
These can then be collected in a rank-lists file for use with the
<match> command to assign papers to individuals.

For example, if you have three selection files sel1.txt, sel2.txt and
sel3.txt all for the same journal set, they can be collected and used
to generate the corresponding rank list in html format using

    jsets ranks sel1.txt sel2.txt sel3.txt --output=ranks.html

If the selections have more than one journal set, then the desired
journal set can be selected using the --key/-k option.
